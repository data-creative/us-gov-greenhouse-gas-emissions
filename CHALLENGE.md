# Green House Gas (GHG) Reduction Visualization

## Description of the Challenge:

GSA has been working to create an analytical framework and tool to support agencies in meeting the goals outlined in a recent Executive Order 13693-- Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions. The model currently uses several variables to help agencies examine how increasing their use of E-85 capable vehicles and replacing gas-powered vehicles with E-85 capable vehicles would affect their total greenhouse gas emissions.  

The problem statement is: How does increasing an agencyâ€™s use of other alternative fuel vehicles such as diesel-powered, hybrid, and electric vehicles rather than traditional gas-powered vehicles affect the level of greenhouse gas emissions over a period of time?

## Goals for the Hackathon:

- Our goal for the Hack-a-Thon is to enhance the current GHG reduction visualizations to include other variables such as diesel, hybrid, and electric vehicles
- Incorporate calculations done in SQL Server and a visualization tool that allows agencies to adjust certain levers and view the impact of those levers on their total greenhouse gas emissions

## Skills Needed:

SQL server coding ability, analytical research, experience using Tableau for visualizations
