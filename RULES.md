GSA announces a software programming and data innovation competition hosted by GSA IT’s Digital Services Division that will be held on October 16th, 2015, at the GSA Central Office, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405.  The competition will be open from 9:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., with on-site registration beginning at 8:30 a.m., all competition details can be viewed at http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon-Fall2015 .    

The goal of this competition is to ask the public and academia to develop smart technology solutions in the form of an application, application programming interface (API), and/or data mashup that has the capability to provide GSA with key insights and recommendations for future enhancements.  GSA will challenge software developers, designers, engineers, data scientists, and subject matter experts (SMEs) to create a solution using publicly available GSA data.  

## CHALLENGE EXAMPLES

### Green House Gas (GHG) Reduction Visualization

Enhance the current GHG data reduction visualizations to include other variables such as Diesel, Hybrid, and Electric Vehicles.  Skills desired include database coding ability (e.g., SQL language), analytical research, and experience using data visualization software.

### Data Center Consolidation Mashup and Tool

Multiple stakeholders including the White House, Congress, and Government Agencies, share common interest in better utilizing Government Data Centers.  This has led to multiple report generation from multiple sources to better understand power consumption and Data Center utilization and efficiency.  The purpose of this challenge is to mashup different datasets into visualization and application for all stakeholders to utilize.  Skills desired include Web and Application Developers, User Experience (UX) Designers, Data Scientists, and Data Center SMEs.

### Travel Challenge 2.0 App Development

As a continuation of a Travel Challenge held in 2014, GSA is looking for developers to take the Travel App to the next level.  Developed in Python, this tool is close to Production quality and needs some finishing code and design ideas.  Skills desired include Python Developers and UX Designers.

## DETAILS OF CHALLENGE

Design and create a digital interactive solution in the form of an application, Application Programming Interface (API), and/or data mashup that utilizes federal data collected by GSA.  The technology solution should be innovative!  GSA does not want an analysis tool that tells what is already known.  This should be a forward-thinking solution that enhances transparency.   

The solution should be a data-driven solution to provide meaningful insights that can help drive smarter decisions by federal employees.  The ultimate goal is to help federal agencies use data to its fullest, share data with all agencies, and become transparent to the American Public.

The solution should accomplish two tasks:

1.    Visually display or transmit data in a way that will enhance the way GSA works; and  
2.    Through analysis of the data identify relationships if they exist, and provide valuable insights that could be gained through improved data collection efforts.

Coders, Designers, Engineers, Data Scientists, SMEs from Industry, Academia, and Government are all invited!  Predetermined Teams are welcome and cash prizes will be awarded to the best Projects.  Modification to team make-up may occur based on the number of Participants at the direction of the competition host.  

## DATA
Participants will be provided all final project ideas, existing code, and publicly available datasets in advance of the event.  Event information will be posted on the following page, http://open.gsa.gov/Digital-Innovation-Hackathon-Fall2015, and will be updated as necessary.

## SKILLSETS DESIRED

 + Database Coding (e.g., SQL language)
 + Experience using Data Visualization software (e.g. Tableau, MicroStrategy, etc.)
 + Web and Application Developers
 + User Experience (UX) Designers
 + Data Scientists

## PRIZES

GSA may award up to three team prizes but no more than $1,000 to each member of a winning team.  GSA is not required to award all prizes if the judges determine that a smaller number of entries meet the scope and requirements laid out for this competition, or if the agency plans to only use code from a smaller number of entries.  

Participants can win no more than $1,000 per person.  Funding for this GSA Digital Innovation Hackathon Fall 2015 edition award will come from GSA.  Prizes will be awarded to the winner(s) of the competition via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 days of announcement of the winner(s).  

## ELIGIBILITY  

Eligibility to participate in the GSA Digital Innovation Hackathon Fall 2015 edition and win a prize is limited to entities/individuals:

That have registered to participate in the competition and complied with the rules of the competition as explained in this posting; and

That have been incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, the participant must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.

Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of employment.  However, an individual or entity shall not be deemed ineligible to win prize money because the individual or entity used Federal facilities or consulted with Federal employees during a competition if the facilities and employees are made available to all individuals and entities participating in the competition on an equitable basis.

Predetermined teams of up to 5 members are welcome to include a stand-alone or mix of private industry, non-profit, and academia.  Modification to team make-up may occur based on team skill make-up at the direction of the competition host.

Participants agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from participation in this competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arose through negligence or otherwise.  Participants also agree to obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility, to cover a third party for death, bodily injury, property damage, or loss resulting from an activity carried out in connection with participation in this competition, with the Federal Government named as an additional insured under the registered participant’s insurance policy and registered participants agreeing to indemnify the Federal Government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to the competition activities, and the Federal Government for damage or loss to Government property resulting from such an activity.

As GSA is under a strict duty not to give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual, participants must agree to take diligent care to avoid the appearance of Government endorsement of competition participation and submission.  Participants must agree not to refer to GSA’s use of your submission (be it product or service) in any commercial advertising or similar promotions in a manner that could reasonably imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that the GSA or the federal government endorses, prefers, sponsors, or has an affiliation with participants’ products or services.  Participants agree that GSA’s trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, or the fact that GSA awarded a prize to a participant, shall not be used by the participant to imply direct GSA endorsement of participant or participant’s submission.  Both participants and GSA may list the other party’s name in a publicly available customer or other list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than any other third-party name.



## REQUIREMENTS

The final solution should be open source code and placed on a GSA site to be specified to participants the day of the event. “Open source” refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.
